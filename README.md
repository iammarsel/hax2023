# Recipe Lab Mobile Application 

## Recipe Lab is a mobile app used to scan a person's fridge and suggest recipes based on the ingredients a user currently has

This project was created during a hackathon called Hackabull in University of South Florida in Spring 2023. It is created by a team of 4 using React Native, JavaScript, Google Vision, CockroachDB. Here is how it works
- Scan fridge using a picture or your camera
- A list of scanned ingredients shows where user can add or remove ingredients
- User can like or dislike recipes to save them
- User can complete recipes for experience points
